# Design-Pattern-Desicions

## Project goals

For this project I wanted to create a contract that acted as a domain name service. This means users need to be able to:

## Claim names
To claim names, I created function "claimNewName". This function allows users to claim names that have not been claimed. a succesful claiming adds a new DomainName Struct to the domainNames mapping, assignes the name a unique integer ID in the "numberToName" mapping, and increments the "numberOfClaimedNames" variable, allowing us to loop over all names later.

## Set the corresponding IP address of names

function "setNamesIPAddress" takes a name and an IP address, and set's that name struct's corresponding IP address, assuming msg.sender is the owner of that name.

## Transfer names to other users

There are three methods of transfering ownership of names:

### ForFree

Transfers ownership of a name to a specified address

### Publicly

Offers ownership of a name for specified amount of Wei. Any address can accept this offer and gain ownership of the offered name, provided they pay the required Wei.

### Privately

Offers ownership of a name to a specified user for a specified amount of Wei. Only the specified user can take ownership of the privately offered name, provided they pay the requested Wei.

### Additional information

Users can also revoke offers if they decide to before the offer has been fulfilled.

## Get information about what names users own and their current state.

Getting information about names is currently done via multiple functions. This is because solidity cannot currently return or emit structs.
